Documenting a program is crucial as it ensures that the code is understandable, maintainable, and usable by others. Clear documentation helps in preserving the developer's intent, making it easier for future developers to debug, extend, and optimize the code. It also facilitates collaboration, knowledge transfer, and onboarding of new team members, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective project development and management.
