Here's a more polished and professional version of your statement:


---

Thank you for your question.

If you are referring to any official records or documents, to the best of my knowledge, there are none, as neither party has policies that explicitly prohibit external engagements or require prior approval for moonlighting.

However, in casual conversations, I have been transparent with both parties and have mentioned that I was working two jobs that do not pose any conflict of interest, primarily to support my financial needs.

Let me know if you want this to sound more formal/legal or more conversational depending on the context (e.g., HR, legal, or casual clarification).


hi I'm Moran. I joined LEC earlier this month. something about myself. I'm an average ESFP, that means fun-loving, energetic, live in the moment and desire to experience life to the fullest. 

I was from previous Coe and some of you may know it's a career transition programme. So my degree was in civil engineering and I was a bridge engineer before.

something interesting about myself. that I started learning Chinese calligraphy from 6 year's old and I used to participate in competition in Singapore. I was also once a calligraphy class teacher in ang mo kio community centre.

I am also a passionate Dota2 player. recently I'm going to reach 10k hours of gameplay. this is a screenshot of my steam account. the nickname in Chinese actually means win one game first. so please message me if you also play.

thank you!
