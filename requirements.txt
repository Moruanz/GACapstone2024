Here's a more polished and professional version of your statement:


---

Thank you for your question.

If you are referring to any official records or documents, to the best of my knowledge, there are none, as neither party has policies that explicitly prohibit external engagements or require prior approval for moonlighting.

However, in casual conversations, I have been transparent with both parties and have mentioned that I was working two jobs that do not pose any conflict of interest, primarily to support my financial needs.

Let me know if you want this to sound more formal/legal or more conversational depending on the context (e.g., HR, legal, or casual clarification).
